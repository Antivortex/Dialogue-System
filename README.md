# Dialogue System

This repo contains one of my pet projects implemented for fun and learning, a system for braching cut scene dialogues. It is implemented as a Unity Editor extension dedicated for creation, editing and saving of native Unity assets containing tree of editable nodes with text. Feel free to use this for your visual novel or RPG project and give me a star.

These screenshots show how to use it and how it looks:
